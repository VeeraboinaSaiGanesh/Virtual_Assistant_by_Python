 This code creates a helpful voice assistant named Jack. Jack can understand your spoken commands, respond with a voice, and perform tasks like opening websites, telling the day, and telling the time. It continuously listens for commands and responds appropriately, making it a useful tool for interacting with your computer through voice.
